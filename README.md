AdminQuest

A sysadmin RPG

## About

The goal of Adminquest is to create an top-down 2D RPG that helps people who are curious about linux system administration
to get some experience playing around with the concepts.

Some quests you might run into would be:

    - deleting files
    - adding users
    - resizing partitions
    - connecting to a network

There are enormous possiblities for fun storytelling using quests like this. The player will not be executing actual commands, but,
similar to an adventure game, they would need a particular item to accomplish a task. For removing files, for instance, the enemies
would be the files while they are required to use the "sword of RM" to _delete_ them. Pretty fun stuff!

This project is super young and there is plenty of room for new ideas.


## Running the Game

Clone the repo and import it into Godot.

You should be able to run and try the game via the Godot editor right away.
