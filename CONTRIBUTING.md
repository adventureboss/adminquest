A lot of the ideas we had at the beginning are listed in the Issues, so we'd love to see those dealt with first.

If you find a new issue or have a new idea worth exploring, please feel free to post an issue.

Try to keep your PRs focused on one issue or task at a time so we don't get overwhelmed with giant blobs of code.

We're learning as we go, so feel free to pitch ideas!
